Corporate Tax Blues\n-----------------------\n\n\"Locks of Sass Inc.\" is born, but corporate taxes leave the baby business crawling instead of running. Zack weeps into his incorporation papers, wishing only distributed profits were taxed.\n\n**View More:** Policy: Corporate Taxation Problem: Corporate taxes can discourage business formation, investment, and growth.
